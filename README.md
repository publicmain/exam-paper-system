# Exam Paper System (MVP)

An exam paper generation system for international curriculum schools (CIE / Edexcel / O-Level / IGCSE / A-Level). Teachers configure subject, chapter, duration, total marks, and question type mix; the system pulls from a tagged question bank, presents an editable paper, and exports PDF + answer key.

**Out of scope for this MVP:** automatic grading, student-facing UI, multi-tenant SaaS, past-paper digitization.

---

## Quick Start (local)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (for Postgres) — or any local Postgres 15
- npm 10+

### 1. Install
```bash
cd C:\Users\yaoke\Projects\exam-paper-system
npm install
```

### 2. Start Postgres
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Configure environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if needed; defaults work with docker-compose
```

The `.env` file contains your Anthropic API key (already filled in) — **never commit this file**.

### 4. Run migrations + seed
```bash
npm run db:migrate    # first time: it will prompt to name the migration; default "init" is fine
npm run db:seed
```

Seed creates:
- Two demo users:
  - `teacher@school.local` / `teacher123`
  - `admin@school.local` / `admin123`
- Two subjects: CIE A-Level Mathematics 9709 + Physics 9702 with topic trees
- ~25 demo questions (school-original, no past-paper content)
- One default paper template

### 5. Run dev servers
```bash
npm run dev
```
- API: http://localhost:4000  (health: http://localhost:4000/api/health)
- Web: http://localhost:5173

Open http://localhost:5173 and log in.

## Demo Workflow

1. **Login** as teacher@school.local
2. **Dashboard** → "+ Create New Paper"
3. **Step 1**: pick a preset (e.g. "Weekly Test 60 min")
4. **Step 2**: choose subject (CIE 9709 Mathematics) → component (P1) → tick a few topic chapters (e.g. Quadratics, Functions)
5. **Step 3**: review duration / total marks / question mix → "Generate Paper"
6. **Paper editor**: reorder, replace, edit, delete. The validation card shows total marks vs target, time vs duration, topic coverage, difficulty spread.
7. **Export PDF** → cover sheet + LaTeX-rendered questions + answer space
8. **Export Answer Key PDF** → same paper but with marked correct options and answer text

## Generation Algorithm (in plain English)

Given `{subject, component, topicFilter, durationMin, totalMarks, questionMix, difficultyDist, excludeRecentDays}`:

1. **Preflight checks** detect obviously bad configs (warnings, not errors).
2. **Expand topic filter**: if a parent topic is selected, include all descendants.
3. **Build candidate pool**: subject + component + topic + status=active, minus questions used by any class in the last N days.
4. **For each slot in `questionMix`**:
   - Filter pool by question type
   - Bucket by difficulty (1-2 easy, 3 medium, 4-5 hard)
   - Either pick `count` items distributed by `difficultyDist` (MCQ-style slot) **or** greedily pick until `targetMarks` is hit (structured-style slot)
5. **Postflight**: warn if total marks deviates >10% or estimated time deviates >20%.
6. **Persist** with a snapshot of the question content into `paper_questions.snapshotContent` so future master edits never alter historical papers.
7. **Seeded RNG** (mulberry32) — same `seed` reproduces the exact same paper.

Replacement uses the same algorithm but constrained to `(topic, marks, difficulty, type)` matches.

## Editing model — two layers

- **Paper-level edits**: stored in `paper_questions.overrideContent` / `overrideAnswer`. Only affects this paper. Does NOT modify the master question.
- **Master-level edits**: via `PATCH /api/questions/:id`. Creates a new row in `question_versions`. Does NOT retroactively change papers that already snapshotted the old version.

This is the central correctness guarantee — see `apps/api/src/papers/papers.service.ts:updateQuestion`.

---

## LaTeX rendering

- **Browser preview**: KaTeX renders `$...$` inline and `$$...$$` display math live (see `apps/web/src/lib/latex.ts`).
- **PDF**: KaTeX server-side renders to HTML+CSS, then Puppeteer prints to A4 PDF (see `apps/api/src/pdf/templates.ts` and `pdf.service.ts`). KaTeX CSS is loaded from CDN; Puppeteer waits for `networkidle0` to ensure fonts are ready.
- **Chemistry**: KaTeX's `mhchem` extension is included via the `katex` package — use `\ce{H2SO4}` syntax.
- **Diagrams**: store as images via `question_assets` (S3 or local filesystem URL). Auto-generation is out of scope.

---

## Copyright and Compliance Notes

This system is designed to be **safe for school internal use only**.

- All seed questions are flagged `source_type=original_school` (school-authored).
- Past paper questions, when added by teachers, must be flagged `source_type=past_paper_reference` and **only the metadata** (e.g., `9702/22/M/J/19/Q3`) is stored — not the original question text or images. Teachers are expected to obtain the original PDFs from official channels (CAIE School Support Hub / Edexcel Online).
- The PDF footer includes `© School internal use only` to make scope explicit.
- **Do not** upload Cambridge / Pearson original questions in bulk. **Do not** distribute generated PDFs commercially or to non-students.
- Before any external distribution or commercial use, obtain explicit written license from the relevant exam board.

See the design doc for full risk analysis (Cambridge CIE vs Pearson Edexcel separately).

---

## AI labeling

The endpoint `POST /api/ai/suggest-labels` calls Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6` by default) with the question stem, the syllabus topic list, and asks for top 3 topic candidates + suggested difficulty + suggested question type.

- The teacher always reviews and confirms — AI never auto-applies labels.
- If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is unset or set to the placeholder, the endpoint returns a stub response so the UI still works for development.

## Deploying to Railway

This repo is structured to deploy as **two Railway services + one managed Postgres**.

### Service 1 — API
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. On Railway, create a new project → "Deploy from GitHub repo".
3. Select **root directory `/`** (the API Dockerfile path is in `railway.json`).
4. Add a **Postgres** plugin. Railway auto-injects `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Set environment variables:
   - `JWT_SECRET` (generate a random 64-char string)
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `MOCK_AUTH=false`
   - `PORT` is auto-set by Railway (the API reads `PORT` as fallback).
6. The Dockerfile runs `prisma migrate deploy && node dist/main.js` on each boot, so migrations are applied automatically.
7. After first deploy, exec into the service and run seed once:
   ```
   railway run --service api npm run db:seed -w @app/api
   ```
   (or run via Railway CLI / job)

### Service 2 — Web
1. Create a second service on the same Railway project, also pointing at the GitHub repo.
2. Set **root directory `apps/web`** and use the Dockerfile in that directory.
3. Set build arg `VITE_API_URL` to your API service's public URL (e.g., `https://exam-api.up.railway.app`).
4. Deploy.

### Service 3 — Postgres
Use Railway's managed Postgres plugin; copy `DATABASE_URL` into the API service.

### Persistent storage
This MVP stores PDF output transiently (returned in HTTP response) and question images via URL references. If you add image uploads, mount a Railway Volume to `STORAGE_DIR`.

---

## Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

Currently runs `vitest` against `apps/api/test/generation.spec.ts` (preflight checks). The full integration test set against a live database is planned but not in this MVP.

### Manual test plan

1. ✅ Login with seeded teacher account
2. ✅ List question bank — should show ~25 questions across 9709 + 9702
3. ✅ Open one question — LaTeX in stem renders correctly in preview pane
4. ✅ Create new question, click "Suggest topic & difficulty" → AI returns suggestion (or stub)
5. ✅ Save question as draft, then publish (status becomes `active`)
6. ✅ Run paper wizard → preset → 9709 P1 → tick 2-3 topics → generate
7. ✅ Paper editor: reorder Q1↔Q2, replace Q3, edit Q4 stem, delete Q5
8. ✅ Validation card updates total marks live
9. ✅ Export paper PDF → opens, LaTeX renders, header has school/subject/duration/marks
10. ✅ Export answer key PDF → MCQ correct options marked, structured answers shown

---

## Roadmap (Phase 2+)

- Image upload pipeline + S3 / Railway volume
- DOCX export (Phase 2)
- AI-generated original questions (with mandatory review queue)
- Past-paper PDF semi-automatic ingestion (cropping tool, metadata-only)
- Approval workflow (head teacher reviews question bank changes)
- Student-side: MCQ auto-marking, individualized weak-topic practice
- Multi-school tenancy (only after copyright due diligence)

---

## Backup & Recovery

Database backup automation and the full disaster-recovery runbook live in [`docs/disaster-recovery.md`](docs/disaster-recovery.md). It covers RTO/RPO targets, daily cron setup, three off-site copy strategies (rsync, USB, `rclone`), and the step-by-step restore procedure with post-recovery validation queries.

Quick commands:

```bash
# Take a backup (writes to ./backups/, rotates to keep 7 most recent)
./scripts/backup.sh

# Restore from a specific dump (interactive — requires typing "RESTORE")
./scripts/restore.sh ./backups/exam-paper-system-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dump
```

On Linux/macOS, make the scripts executable once: `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`. On Windows, run them inside WSL2 or Git Bash.

**Warning:** the dev DB has **no automatic backup** out of the box — `backup.sh` only runs when an operator (or cron) invokes it. Production / Railway operators must install the cron entry documented in the runbook before relying on recovery.
